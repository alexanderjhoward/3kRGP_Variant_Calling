# Step 0: Background
Welcome to my tutorial on how to use the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project (3kRGP) dataset to call sequence variants of interest!

## The Data
*Insert background on 3kRGP here*

## The Code
This repository uses scripts for two coding languages: bash and R.
* Scripts that end in ".sh" are bash shell scripts that can be run on a terminal.
* Scripts that end in ".R" are R scripts that can be run on an application like RStudio.

## Setting up a conda environment
A conda environment helps support the use of specalized packages with bash scripts. Attached is a conda environment containing all the packages that need to be installed to run all the bash scripts in this pipeline.

```{bash}

```

## The Computation
I do genome seaches on the UC Davis "FARM" computing cluster as I have more storage and processing power available to me on my account there compared to my laptop. All the scripts are formatted to support their computing queueing system called "SLURM".
