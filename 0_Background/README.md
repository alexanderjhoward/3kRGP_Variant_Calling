# Step 0: Background

## Code
This repository uses scripts for two coding languages: bash and R. Scripts that end in ".sh" are bash "shell" scripts that can be run on a terminal. Scripts that end in ".R" are R scripts that can be run on an application like RStudio.

## Set up conda environment
A conda environment helps support the use of specalized packages with bash scripts. Attached is a conda environment containing all the packages that need to be installed to run all the bash scripts in this pipeline.

```{bash}

## Computation
I do genome seaches on the UC Davis "FARM" computing cluster as I have more storage and processing power available to me on my account there compared to my laptop. All the scripts are formatted to support their computing queueing system called "SLURM".
